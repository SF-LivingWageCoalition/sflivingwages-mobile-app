# San Francisco Living Wage Coalition

[SF Living Wage Coalition](https://www.livingwage-sf.org/) is a non-profit organization engaged in transformative thinking of the economy for a more livable, healthy, and prosperous community.

## Mobile App

In the app, users will be able to share pieces of art (paintings, drawings and digital), photographs and books. Moreover, users will be notified about new events such as art auctions and events that the organization hosts. In the future, users will be able to donate money to the organization, upload events such as rallies or marches, have a wage-rights toolkit, and an interactive real-time map where users can search categories such as legal aid, or find businesses known for wage-theft, unsafe working conditions, and other violations.
