**Published by July 18, 2014**

### a. Campaign for a Community Jobs Program

We are working to get the City and County of San Francisco to pass model legislation that will transform welfare-to-work programs into genuine job training that provides a path to living wage jobs. [Read more](https://www.livingwage-sf.org/transform-welfare-to-work-programs/what-is-calworks/)

### b. Organizing a Union of Welfare-to-Work Program Participants

To pass this model legislation, we are organizing welfare-to-work program participants to have a voice in how the legislation is drafted and these programs are designed. This will be the foundation for organizing their own union to provide them with the political power to negotiate better working conditions and more opportunities for permanent jobs. [Read more](http://www.livingwage-sf.org/transform-welfare-to-work/organizing-welfare-to-work-collective-bargaining)

### c. Building a National Network of Welfare-to-Work Program Participants

We are sharing strategies on building a national movement to change welfare as we know it, from dead end programs to real job training and career opportunities. The current welfare to work programs do note provide read job traingin, but rather forces desperate parents into low-wage, menial labor positions.

*Published December 11, 2025*

When there are more union worksites, even non-union employers pay more in competing for workers. Often public sector jobs set the bar for the private sector to match.

### e. Gig Workers Organizing

Popular app-based ride-sharing companies, Uber and Lyft, have paved the way for many workers to make income on a flexible schedule. However, their opposition to Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) has pushed drivers to be classified as independent contractors rather than employees.

    title: "End Mass Incarceration and Prison Labor",
    text: `

A broken criminal justice system is turning to mass incarceration as a source of cheap prison labor.
The formerly incarcerated or convicted then face lifetime job discrimination that leaves them unemployed or in the dirtiest, most dangerous, and lowest paying jobs.

---

### a. Stopping Mass Incarceration and Use of Prison Labor
Policies adopted in the “War on Drugs” and prison expansion have exponentially increased the percentage of incarcerated people in the United States.
Recent policies have disproportionately affected African American and Latino communities.
The Prison Industrial Complex is comprised of private companies that are benefiting from prison construction and prison labor.

### b. Ban the Box Campaign to End Lifetime Discrimination of Formerly Incarcerated or Convicted People
The stigma of felony convictions and incarceration follows people long after their court-mandated “debt to society” has been paid.
19.8 million Americans (8.6% of the adult population) face incredible
[hardship and discrimination](http://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/incarcerated3.pdf)
as they fight an uphill battle to rebuild their lives and stay out of the criminal justice system.
In many ways, a felony conviction is like a scarlet letter that can severely limit and prevent a person’s ability to find housing, employment, or to receive student loans or aid from social welfare programs.
[Read more](http://www.livingwage-sf.org/mass-incarceration/discrimination-against-formerly-incarcerated-people/)

### c. The Roots of Mass Incarceration are in the Prison Industrial Complex
Over the last few decades, the U.S. has experienced a drastic rise in incarceration rates and prison investment.
This rapid expansion of incarceration in the U.S. has origins in the 1970s, during which particular policy and legislative decisions that continued to be supported in proceeding decades created the effects of mass incarceration we see today.

    title: "Fix a Broken Immigration System",
    text: `

A broken immigration system is pushing undocumented workers into the shadows, leaving workers vulnerable to violations of their workplace rights, forcing them to accept lower pay, and creating guest worker programs in which employers can have workers deported for speaking out for better conditions. Immigration reform is needed.

---

### a. Immigration policy is pushing workers into the shadows
Fear has gripped America’s undocumented workers. Many are staying home. The impact is being felt not only in immigrants’ homes and communities, but also in the industries that rely on immigrants as a source of willing and inexpensive labor, including residential construction, agriculture, senior care, and hospitality.
U.S. consumers will soon feel the pain.

### b. Immigration reform
The [Dignity Campaign](https://www.migrantdignity.org/) creates a vision of progressive immigration reform.
We are part of a national network of immigrant rights organizations building a grassroots movement that demands immigration reform that provides full legalization, family reunification, an end to employer sanctions and other workplace enforcement, an end to the militarization of the border, and an end to guest worker programs.
[Read more](https://www.livingwage-sf.org/immigration-reform/dignity-campaign/)

### c. Agribusiness uses guest worker program to drive down wages for farmworkers
Agribusinesses are currently abusing guest workers with H-2A visas who work on farms.
These guest workers have no protection rights and are vulnerable to discrimination and deportation.
[Read more](https://www.livingwage-sf.org/immigration-reform/agribusiness-and-a-broken-immigration-system-uses-guest-worker-program-to-drive-down-wages-for-farmworkers/)

### d. Stopping the Cancellation of Temporary Protected Status
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a program enacted by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s to enable immigrants from countries experiencing armed conflict or natural disaster to work and live in the United States.
In 2018, the Trump administration moved to cancel TPS for more than 400,000 migrants.
The San Francisco Living Wage Coalition, along with many other organizations, formed the NorCal TPS Coalition to help protect TPS holders.

### e. Immigration Activist Detained By ICE
On March 25, 2025, Alfredo Juarez Zererino, also known as “LELO,” was detained by immigration and customs enforcement early in the morning when he was dropping his partner off at a tulip bulb company in Mount Vernon, according to *The Seattle Times*.
[Read more](https://www.livingwage-sf.org/immigration-activist-detained-by-ice/)

### f. The Future of DACA under the Trump Administration
In his presidential campaign, President Trump expressed a desire to terminate programs such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS).
Both programs allow immigrants to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.
During Trump’s first term in office, he repeatedly threatened to end DACA, causing fear among recipients and undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

    title: "Enact Fair Trade Policies",
    text: `

The San Francisco Living Wage Coalition campaigns to demand that Congress enacts fair trade agreements that have protections for workers and the environment. Bad trade agreements that do not have worker protections and rely on moving manufacturing and production to low-wage areas of the world are resulting in a vicious spiral to the bottom, without a safety net for those displaced from their livelihoods nor job training programs to provide skills for new jobs.

### b. Campaign for the Right to Organize a Union
This new era of laissez-faire capitalism that has spurred widespread economic globalization permitted by establishment of neoliberal free-trade policies has created a trend of fragmented labor in which U.S.-owned companies are able to outsource their labor to countries such as Mexico.

### c. Building of a Culture of Solidarity
Since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, corporations in the U.S. and Mexico have been driving down wages to reduce labor costs. As a result, workers in both countries have been supporting each other in solidarity.

### a. Campaign to Raise the State Minimum Wage
The Living Wage Act, an unsuccessful proposition on the November 2024 ballot to increase the California minimum wage to $18 an hour by 2025, would have built on existing minimum wage policies and would have raised pay for around five million California workers according to two new companion reports released by the UC Berkeley Labor Center and the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics (CWED).

### b. Campaign for Wage Increases for City-funded Nonprofit Workers, IHSS Home Care Workers and CalWORKs Parents in Community Service Jobs
In the City and County of San Francisco Memorandum of Understanding with SEIU Local 2015, the wages for IHSS home care workers were negotiated to increase to $21.50 per hour on July 1 and $22 per hour on January 1, 2025.

In an agreement reached with the Mayor and SEIU Local 1021 in 2023, the minimum rate under the Minimum Compensation Ordinance was negotiated to increase to $20.25 per hour on July 1, 2024.

This was part of a campaign initiated by the San Francisco Living Wage Coalition in meetings with SEIU Local 2015 and 1021. The goal is to set a path to $25 per hour.
